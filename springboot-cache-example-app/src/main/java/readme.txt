Differenc b/w cache and cookie???
1- Cookie is used to store a user details. 
2- Often track information how frequently user visit  what is the time of visit
3- What is the button or product click by the user etc
   like u vist amazon look for shoe they show shoe suggestion
4- Cache is used to store a information to render the page faster
   open website with large page images etc Huge data 
   this may take some time to render to the user 
u can use cache to store such type of data on user computer
